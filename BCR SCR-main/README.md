## BCR SCR
Machine learning-based integrative analysis develops a signature for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) in primary prostate cancer.

## signature generated by an integrated approach based on machine learning
101 combinations of 10 machine learning algorithms, including Lasso, Ridge, stepwise Cox, CoxBoost, random survival forest (RSF), elastic network (Enet), partial least squares regression for Cox (plsRcox), supervised principal components (SuperPC), generalized boosted regression modeling (GBM), and survival support vector machine (survival-SVM) based on 10-folds cross-validation were further used to screen out the most valuable signature with the highest C-index.

## Comparison of published signatures
For a comprehensive comparison of the performance of BCR SCR with other signatures, the published signatures over the past 4 years were systematically retrieved. Ultimately, 102 signatures were enrolled in this study. These 102 signatures were closely related to different biological features, including lipid metabolism, glycolysis, cell apoptosis, ferroptosis, hypoxia, and inflammation. Notably, BCR SCR comprehensive performance in seven long-term cohorts was significantly better than that of other signatures.
